# Enhanced FlexiSearch Brain Implementation

## Overview

The Enhanced FlexiSearch system is a sophisticated movies/TV discovery engine powered by TMDB that can understand natural language queries and return highly relevant results using advanced hybrid ranking algorithms.

## Key Features

### üß† Intelligent Intent Detection
- **Exact Title Recognition**: High-confidence matching for specific movie/TV titles
- **Similarity Requests**: Detects "movies like X" or "shows similar to Y" patterns
- **Multi-Entity Extraction**: Handles titles, people, genres, moods, years, and runtime preferences
- **Context Understanding**: Differentiates between exact lookups vs discovery requests

### üîç Comprehensive Search Strategy

#### Step A: Intent Parsing
- Uses LLM to extract structured intent from natural language
- Identifies: titles, people, genres, moods, year ranges, runtime constraints
- Determines request type: exact lookup vs similarity discovery

#### Step B: ID Resolution 
- Multi-search API to classify results into movie/tv/person
- High-confidence exact matching with title similarity scoring
- Person search for actor/director-based queries
- Candidate collection for discovery scenarios

#### Step C: Exact Match Detection
- Returns single exact match for high-confidence title lookups
- Considers title similarity, year constraints, and media type
- Bypasses similarity ranking for direct title requests

#### Step D: Hybrid Discovery Engine
- **Genre/Mood Discovery**: Maps natural language to TMDB genre IDs
- **People-Based Search**: Uses person IDs in discovery filters
- **Quality Filters**: Enforces vote count thresholds for reliable results
- **Multiple Sort Strategies**: Popularity and rating-based sorting
- **TMDB Similar/Recommendations**: Augments with platform recommendations

## üèÜ Advanced Hybrid Ranking System

### Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm

The enhanced ranking system uses weighted combination of multiple factors:

```
Total Score = 
  Base Score √ó 1.0 +           // Source confidence
  Genre Overlap √ó 0.8 +        // Genre/mood matching
  Keyword Themes √ó 0.7 +       // Thematic similarity  
  People Overlap √ó 0.9 +       // Cast/crew matching
  Year Proximity √ó 0.5 +       // Release date relevance
  Language Match √ó 0.3 +       // Language preferences
  Runtime Match √ó 0.4 +        // Runtime constraints
  Quality Signals √ó 0.6        // Rating/popularity
```

### Ranking Factors

#### 1. Base Score (Source Confidence)
- **Exact Match**: 3.0 - Perfect title match
- **Multi-Search (Exact)**: 2.8 - High-confidence title similarity
- **TMDB Similar**: 1.8 - Platform's built-in similarity
- **TMDB Recommendations**: 1.7 - Platform recommendations
- **Person Search**: 1.6 - Actor/director matches
- **Quality Discovery**: 1.4 - High-rated genre matches
- **Genre Discovery**: 1.2 - General genre/mood matches

#### 2. Genre Overlap
- Direct TMDB genre ID matching
- Text-based genre keyword detection
- Mood-to-genre mapping with confidence scoring
- Weighted by number of matching criteria

#### 3. Keyword/Theme Overlap
- Thematic keyword extraction from titles
- Overview text similarity analysis
- Semantic theme matching
- Cross-reference with user intent

#### 4. People Overlap
- Direct person ID matching from searches
- Text-based actor/director detection
- Weighted by person prominence
- Higher scores for exact person matches

#### 5. Year Proximity
- Exact year matches: highest score
- Range matching with proximity scoring
- Era-based similarity for broader matches
- Recent content boost when no year specified

#### 6. Quality Signals
- TMDB rating normalization (0-10 scale)
- Vote count thresholds for reliability
- Popularity signals from discovery
- Combined quality confidence scoring

## üéØ Response Formatting
